This is my .vimrc and tagfile including stl_tags and so on.
First of all, we should install vundle to manage all the plugins accomplished with git. The instruction is "git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle", next is ctags and cscope. After that, install all the plugins in Vundle.
